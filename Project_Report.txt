"Project Report

Hurdles I have faced so far:

One of the main challenges I faced was figuring out how to keep track of the original location of each file that is moved to the trash. Since the script moves files to a single folder, I need to remember where each file came from in case they need to be restored later.


How did I solve them:

I created a .trashinfo file that logs the original path of each file when it is moved to the trash.


Next Steps:

Add more error checking.
Polish with better formatting and comments.
Create a â€“help command that shows you how to use the script."
